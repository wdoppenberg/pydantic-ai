# Evals

_Evals_ is shorthand for both AI system _Evaluation_ as a broad topic and for specific _Evaluation Metrics_ or _Evaluators_ as individual tests. Ironically, the overloading of this term makes it difficult to evaluate what people are even talking about when they say "Evals" (without further context).

!!! danger "Warning"
    Unlike unit tests, evals are an emerging art/science; anyone who claims to know exactly how your evals should be defined can safely be ignored.

## Pydantic Evals Package

**Pydantic Evals** is a powerful evaluation framework designed to help you systematically test and evaluate the performance and accuracy of the systems you build, from augmented LLMs to multi-agent systems.

Install Pydantic Evals as part of the Pydantic AI (agent framework) package, or stand-alone.

We've designed Pydantic Evals to be useful while not being too opinionated since we (along with everyone else) are still figuring out best practices. We'd love your [feedback](help.md) on the package and how we can improve it.

!!! note "In Beta"
    Pydantic Evals support was [introduced](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic-ai/pull/935) in v0.0.47 and is currently in beta. The API is subject to change and the documentation is incomplete.

## Code-First Evaluation

Pydantic Evals follows a **code-first approach** where you define all evaluation components (datasets, experiments, tasks, cases and evaluators) in Python code, or as serialized data loaded by Python code. This differs from platforms with fully web-based configuration.

When you run an _Experiment_ you'll see a progress indicator and can print the results wherever you run your python code (IDE, terminal, etc). You also get a report object back that you can serialize and store or send to a notebook or other application for further visualization and analysis.

If you are using [Pydantic Logfire](https://logfire.pydantic.dev/docs/guides/web-ui/evals/), your experiment results automatically appear in the Logfire web interface for visualization, comparison, and collaborative analysis. Logfire serves as a observability layer - you write and run evals in code, then view and analyze results in the web UI.

## Installation

To install the Pydantic Evals package, run:

```bash
pip/uv-add pydantic-evals
```

`pydantic-evals` does not depend on `pydantic-ai`, but has an optional dependency on `logfire` if you'd like to
use OpenTelemetry traces in your evals, or send evaluation results to [logfire](https://pydantic.dev/logfire).

```bash
pip/uv-add 'pydantic-evals[logfire]'
```

## Pydantic Evals Data Model

### Data Model Diagram

```
Dataset (1) ──────────── (Many) Case
│                        │
│                        │
└─── (Many) Experiment ──┴─── (Many) Case results
     │
     └─── (1) Task
     │
     └─── (Many) Evaluator
```

### Key Relationships

1. **Dataset → Cases**: One Dataset contains many Cases
2. **Dataset → Experiments**: One Dataset can be used across many Experiments
   over time
3. **Experiment → Case results**: One Experiment generates results by
   executing each Case
4. **Experiment → Task**: One Experiment evaluates one defined Task
5. **Experiment → Evaluators**: One Experiment uses multiple Evaluators. Dataset-wide Evaluators are run against all Cases, and Case-specific Evaluators against their respective Cases

### Data Flow

1. **Dataset creation**: Define cases and evaluators in YAML/JSON, or directly in Python
2. **Experiment execution**: Run `dataset.evaluate_sync(task_function)`
3. **Cases run**: Each Case is executed against the Task
4. **Evaluation**: Evaluators score the Task outputs for each Case
5. **Results**: All Case results are collected into a summary report

!!! note "A metaphor"

    A useful metaphor (although not perfect) is to think of evals like a **Unit Testing** framework:

    - **Cases + Evaluators** are your individual unit tests - each one
    defines a specific scenario you want to test, complete with inputs
    and expected outcomes. Just like a unit test, a case asks: _"Given
    this input, does my system produce the right output?"_

    -  **Datasets** are like test suites - they are the scaffolding that holds your unit
    tests together. They group related cases and define shared
    evaluation criteria that should apply across all tests in the suite.

    - **Experiments** are like running your entire test suite and getting a
    report. When you execute `dataset.evaluate_sync(my_ai_function)`,
    you're running all your cases against your AI system and
    collecting the results - just like running `pytest` and getting a
    summary of passes, failures, and performance metrics.

    The key difference from traditional unit testing is that AI systems are
    probabilistic. If you're type checking you'll still get a simple pass/fail,
    but scores for text outputs are likely qualitative and/or categorical,
    and more open to interpretation.

## Datasets and Cases

In Pydantic Evals, everything begins with `Dataset`s and `Case`s:

- [`Case`][pydantic_evals.Case]: A single test scenario corresponding to Task inputs. Can also optionally have a name, expected outputs, metadata, and evaluators.
- [`Dataset`][pydantic_evals.Dataset]: A collection of test Cases designed for the evaluation of a specific task or function.

```python {title="simple_eval_dataset.py"}
from pydantic_evals import Case, Dataset

case1 = Case(
    name='simple_case',
    inputs='What is the capital of France?',
    expected_output='Paris',
    metadata={'difficulty': 'easy'},
)

dataset = Dataset(cases=[case1])
```

_(This example is complete, it can be run "as is")_

## Evaluators

Evaluators analyze and score the results of your Task when tested against a Case.

These can be a classic unit test: deterministic, code-based checks, such as testing model output format with a regex, or checking for the appearance of PII or sensitive data. Alternatively Evaluators can assess the non-deterministic model outputs for qualities like accuracy, precision/recall, hallucinations or instruction-following.

While both kinds of testing are useful in LLM systems, classical code-based tests are cheaper and easier than tests which require either human or machine review of model outputs. We encourage you to look for quick wins of this type, when setting up a test framework for your system.

Pydantic Evals includes several built-in evaluators and allows you to define custom evaluators:

```python {title="simple_eval_evaluator.py" requires="simple_eval_dataset.py"}
from dataclasses import dataclass

from pydantic_evals.evaluators import Evaluator, EvaluatorContext
from pydantic_evals.evaluators.common import IsInstance

from simple_eval_dataset import dataset

dataset.add_evaluator(IsInstance(type_name='str'))  # (1)!


@dataclass
class MyEvaluator(Evaluator):
    async def evaluate(self, ctx: EvaluatorContext[str, str]) -> float:  # (2)!
        if ctx.output == ctx.expected_output:
            return 1.0
        elif (
            isinstance(ctx.output, str)
            and ctx.expected_output.lower() in ctx.output.lower()
        ):
            return 0.8
        else:
            return 0.0


dataset.add_evaluator(MyEvaluator())
```

1. You can add built-in evaluators to a dataset using the [`add_evaluator`][pydantic_evals.Dataset.add_evaluator] method.
2. This custom evaluator returns a simple score based on whether the output matches the expected output.

_(This example is complete, it can be run "as is")_

## Running Experiments

Performing evaluations involves running a task against all cases in a dataset, also known as running an "experiment".

Putting the above two examples together and using the more declarative `evaluators` kwarg to [`Dataset`][pydantic_evals.Dataset]:

```python {title="simple_eval_complete.py"}
from pydantic_evals import Case, Dataset
from pydantic_evals.evaluators import Evaluator, EvaluatorContext, IsInstance

case1 = Case(  # (1)!
    name='simple_case',
    inputs='What is the capital of France?',
    expected_output='Paris',
    metadata={'difficulty': 'easy'},
)


class MyEvaluator(Evaluator[str, str]):
    def evaluate(self, ctx: EvaluatorContext[str, str]) -> float:
        if ctx.output == ctx.expected_output:
            return 1.0
        elif (
            isinstance(ctx.output, str)
            and ctx.expected_output.lower() in ctx.output.lower()
        ):
            return 0.8
        else:
            return 0.0


dataset = Dataset(
    cases=[case1],
    evaluators=[IsInstance(type_name='str'), MyEvaluator()],  # (3)!
)


async def guess_city(question: str) -> str:  # (4)!
    return 'Paris'


report = dataset.evaluate_sync(guess_city)  # (5)!
report.print(include_input=True, include_output=True, include_durations=False)  # (6)!

1. Create a [test case][pydantic_evals.Case] as above
2. Also create a custom evaluator function as above
3. Create a [`Dataset`][pydantic_evals.Dataset] with test cases, also set the [`evaluators`][pydantic_evals.Dataset.evaluators] when creating the dataset
4. Our function to evaluate.
5. Run the evaluation with [`evaluate_sync`][pydantic_evals.Dataset.evaluate_sync], which runs the function against all test cases in the dataset, and returns an [`EvaluationReport`][pydantic_evals.reporting.EvaluationReport] object.
6. Print the report with [`print`][pydantic_evals.reporting.EvaluationReport.print], which shows the results of the evaluation, including input and output. We have omitted duration here just to keep the printed output from changing from run to run.

## Evaluation with `LLMJudge`

In this example we evaluate a method for generating recipes based on customer orders.

1. Define models for our task — Input for recipe generation task and output of the task.
2. Define our recipe generation function - this is the task we want to evaluate.
3. Create a dataset with different test cases and different rubrics.
4. No expected output, we'll let the LLM judge the quality.
5. Case-specific evaluator with a focused rubric using [`LLMJudge`][pydantic_evals.evaluators.LLMJudge].
6. Dataset-level evaluators that apply to all cases, including a general quality rubric for all recipes
7. By default `LLMJudge` uses `openai:gpt-4o`, here we use a specific Anthropic model.

## Saving and Loading Datasets

Datasets can be saved to and loaded from YAML or JSON files.

```python {title="save_load_dataset_example.py" test="skip"}

## OpenTelemetry Integration

Pydantic Evals integrates with OpenTelemetry for tracing.

The [`EvaluatorContext`][pydantic_evals.evaluators.context.EvaluatorContext] includes a property called `span_tree`
which returns a [`SpanTree`][pydantic_evals.otel.span_tree.SpanTree]. The `SpanTree` provides a way to query and analyze
the spans generated during function execution. This provides a way to access the results of instrumentation during
evaluation.

!!! note
    If you just want to write unit tests that ensure that specific spans are produced during calls to your evaluation
    task, it's usually better to just use the `logfire.testing.capfire` fixture directly.

There are two main ways this is useful.

Pydantic Evals allows you to generate test datasets using LLMs with [`generate_dataset`][pydantic_evals.generation.generate_dataset].

Datasets can be generated in either JSON or YAML format, in both cases a JSON schema file is generated alongside the dataset and referenced in the dataset, so you should get type checking and auto-completion in your editor.

```python {title="generate_dataset_example.py"}
from __future__ import annotations

from pathlib import Path

from pydantic import BaseModel, Field

from pydantic_evals import Dataset
from pydantic_evals.generation import generate_dataset


class QuestionInputs(BaseModel, use_attribute_docstrings=True):  # (1)!
    """Model for question inputs."""

    question: str
    """A question to answer"""
    context: str | None = None
    """Optional context for the question"""


class AnswerOutput(BaseModel, use_attribute_docstrings=True):  # (2)!
    """Model for expected answer outputs."""

    answer: str
    """The answer to the question"""
    confidence: float = Field(ge=0, le=1)
    """Confidence level (0-1)"""


class MetadataType(BaseModel, use_attribute_docstrings=True):  # (3)!
    """Metadata model for test cases."""

    difficulty: str
    """Difficulty level (easy, medium, hard)"""
    category: str
    """Question category"""


async def main():
    dataset = await generate_dataset(  # (4)!
        dataset_type=Dataset[QuestionInputs, AnswerOutput, MetadataType],
        n_examples=2,
        extra_instructions="""
        Generate question-answer pairs about world capitals and landmarks.
        Make sure to include both easy and challenging questions.
        """,
    )
    output_file = Path('questions_cases.yaml')
    dataset.to_file(output_file)  # (5)!
    print(output_file.read_text())
    """
    # yaml-language-server: $schema=questions_cases_schema.json
    cases:
    - name: Easy Capital Question
      inputs:
        question: What is the capital of France?
      metadata:
        difficulty: easy
        category: Geography
      expected_output:
        answer: Paris
        confidence: 0.95
      evaluators:

    - name: Challenging Landmark Question
      inputs:
        question: Which world-famous landmark is located on the banks of the Seine River?
      metadata:

        category: Landmarks
      expected_output:
        answer: Eiffel Tower
        confidence: 0.9
      evaluators:
      - EqualsExpected
    """
```

1. Define the schema for the inputs to the task.
2. Define the schema for the expected outputs of the task.
3. Define the schema for the metadata of the test cases.
4. Call [`generate_dataset`][pydantic_evals.generation.generate_dataset] to create a [`Dataset`][pydantic_evals.Dataset] with 2 cases confirming to the schema.
5. Save the dataset to a YAML file, this will also write `questions_cases_schema.json` with the schema JSON schema for `questions_cases.yaml` to make editing easier. The magic `yaml-language-server` comment is supported by at least vscode, jetbrains/pycharm (more details [here](https://github.com/redhat-developer/yaml-language-server#using-inlined-schema)).

You can also write datasets as JSON files:

```python {title="generate_dataset_example_json.py" requires="generate_dataset_example.py"}
from pathlib import Path

from pydantic_evals import Dataset
from pydantic_evals.generation import generate_dataset

from generate_dataset_example import AnswerOutput, MetadataType, QuestionInputs


async def main():

        n_examples=2,
        extra_instructions="""
        Generate question-answer pairs about world capitals and landmarks.
        Make sure to include both easy and challenging questions.
        """,
    )
    output_file = Path('questions_cases.json')
    dataset.to_file(output_file)  # (2)!
    print(output_file.read_text())
    """
    {
      "$schema": "questions_cases_schema.json",
      "cases": [
        {

        }
      ]
    }
    """
```

1. Generate the [`Dataset`][pydantic_evals.Dataset] exactly as above.
2. Save the dataset to a JSON file, this will also write `questions_cases_schema.json` with th JSON schema for `questions_cases.json`. This time the `$schema` key is included in the JSON file to define the schema for IDEs to use while you edit the file, there's no formal spec for this, but it works in vscode and pycharm and is discussed at length in [json-schema-org/json-schema-spec#828](https://github.com/json-schema-org/json-schema-spec/issues/828).

## Integration with Logfire

Pydantic Evals is implemented using OpenTelemetry to record traces of the evaluation process. These traces contain all
the information included in the terminal output as attributes, but also include full tracing from the executions of the
evaluation task function.

You can send these traces to any OpenTelemetry-compatible backend, including [Pydantic Logfire](https://logfire.pydantic.dev/docs/guides/web-ui/evals/).

All you need to do is configure Logfire via `logfire.configure`:

```python {title="logfire_integration.py" test="skip"}
import logfire
from judge_recipes import recipe_dataset, transform_recipe

logfire.configure(
    send_to_logfire='if-token-present',  # (1)!
    environment='development',  # (2)!
    service_name='evals',  # (3)!
)

recipe_dataset.evaluate_sync(transform_recipe)
```

1. The `send_to_logfire` argument controls when traces are sent to Logfire. You can set it to `'if-token-present'` to send data to Logfire only if the `LOGFIRE_TOKEN` environment variable is set. See the [Logfire configuration docs](https://logfire.pydantic.dev/docs/reference/configuration/) for more details.
2. The `environment` argument sets the environment for the traces. It's a good idea to set this to `'development'` when running tests or evaluations and sending data to a project with production data, to make it easier to filter these traces out while reviewing data from your production environment(s).
3. The `service_name` argument sets the service name for the traces. This is displayed in the Logfire UI to help you identify the source of the associated spans.

Logfire has some special integration with Pydantic Evals traces, including a table view of the evaluation results
on the evaluation root span (which is generated in each call to [`Dataset.evaluate`][pydantic_evals.Dataset.evaluate]):

![Logfire Evals Overview](img/logfire-evals-overview.png)

and a detailed view of the inputs and outputs for the execution of each case:

![Logfire Evals Case](img/logfire-evals-case.png)

In addition, any OpenTelemetry spans generated during the evaluation process will be sent to Logfire, allowing you to
visualize the full execution of the code called during the evaluation process:

![Logfire Evals Case Trace](img/logfire-evals-case-trace.png)

This can be especially helpful when attempting to write evaluators that make use of the `span_tree` property of the
[`EvaluatorContext`][pydantic_evals.evaluators.context.EvaluatorContext], as described in the
[OpenTelemetry Integration](#opentelemetry-integration) section above.

This allows you to write evaluations that depend on information about which code paths were executed during the call to
the task function without needing to manually instrument the code being evaluated, as long as the code being evaluated
is already adequately instrumented with OpenTelemetry. In the case of Pydantic AI agents, for example, this can be used
to ensure specific tools are (or are not) called during the execution of specific cases.

Using OpenTelemetry in this way also means that all data used to evaluate the task executions will be accessible in
the traces produced by production runs of the code, making it straightforward to perform the same evaluations on
production data.

1. **Start with simple evaluations** using basic evaluators like [`IsInstance`](https://ai.pydantic.dev/api/pydantic_evals/evaluators/#pydantic_evals.evaluators.IsInstance) and [`EqualsExpected`](https://ai.pydantic.dev/api/pydantic_evals/evaluators/#pydantic_evals.evaluators.EqualsExpected)
2. **Integrate with Logfire** to visualize results and enable team collaboration
3. **Build comprehensive test suites** with diverse cases covering edge cases and performance requirements
4. **Implement custom evaluators** for domain-specific quality metrics
5. **Automate evaluation runs** as part of your development and deployment pipeline
