            and a wind speed of 7.8 mph (12.6 kph) from the west. The humidity is 94%, and there is a 0% chance of precipitation.
            The UV index is 6.8, and the feels-like temperature is also 17°C (62.6°F). \n\nAdditionally, the forecast for
            the day indicates that it will be a comfortable day with a high of 75°F (24°C) and a low of 59°F (15°C). There
            is a slight chance of rain and thunderstorms in the Bay Area due to the remnants of Tropical Storm Mario, but
            it is not expected to significantly impact San Francisco.\n\nIt's worth noting that the weather in San Francisco
            can be quite variable, and the temperature can drop significantly at night, so it's a good idea to dress in layers.
            Overall, it should be a pleasant day in San Francisco, with plenty of sunshine and mild temperatures."
